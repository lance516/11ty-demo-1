# About this demo site

This is a demo site to present the 11ty Static Site Generator.

By using Markdown (.md) file, we can write long essay without worrying much about the HTML tags. Every new paragraph is automatically wrapped by `p` tag.

## Sub-heading

Headings are created by the `#` sign. One `#` means heading 1, `##` means heading 2. At most there are 6 levels of headings.

## Linking between pages

We can create link by using `[word](https://example.com)`. For exmaple, here is a [link to home page](/index.html).
